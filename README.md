# Understanding Senior Users' Frustration of Multiple Clicking, Touching, and Scrolling 
DH110 Weekly Assignment - Week One | Zia Khoshsirat

## First: [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/)
The Department of Homeland Security tries to provide basic but sufficcient information in its website to the potential audience/users regarding the rights, regualtions, and most recent changes which might affect U.S. citizens and foreign travellers. While this department is responsible for varieties of tasks and regulations, the website is fairly simple, avoides an excessively busy homepage. Most of the website's information are placed on a tab ribbon (picture 1)

The issues which I will describe based on the ten hueristics are observed inside these tabs and the tab itself. These issues are tried to be demostrated in separate screenshots and highlighted with red dash lines. In the table below, the evaluation is categorized as *fine*, *bad*, *worse*. The analysis is performed by imagining that the operating system which our potential senior user working with is either a tablet (touched screen with no mounted typecover) or a PC (Microsoft Windows 10). 

Heuristics | Evaluation | Consideration 
--------------------------|---------------------------|------------
1.Visibility of System Status | fine (on a PC - **picture 1**): related to the fourth huerestic, the homepage tab does not respond to the movement of the mouse hovering over the letters other than the appearance of a line under them. Since the users have been in interaction with other websites, they wait for a dropdown menu which tells them more about what they will see in Topics, News, etc. As the underline is not making a noticable contrast for our user, scrolling down could be a way to find relavant information about travelling. The transformation of the mouse arrow pointer to a hand is helpful for the user, might convince him/her/their to click. However, as this user does not know what to excpect due to the absence of a dropdown menu, going back and forth to the homepage is highly possible.   | A high contrast between the letters and the underline could be helpful in increading the visibility of the change. A better option is to design a dropdown menu which reponds to the movmeent of of the mouse. A combination of both is another possbility.
