<summary>"click to expand"</summary>
The Department of Homeland Security tries to provide basic but sufficcient information in its website to the potential audience/users regarding the rights, regualtions, and most recent changes which might affect U.S. citizens and foreign travellers. While this department is responsible for varieties of tasks and regulations, the website is fairly simple, avoides an excessively busy homepage. Most of the website's information are placed on a tab ribbon (picture 1)

</p>
The issues which I will describe based on the ten hueristics are observed inside these tabs and the tab itself. These issues are tried to be demostrated in separate screenshots and highlighted with red dash lines. In the table below, the evaluation is categorized as *good, fine, bad, worse*. The analysis is performed by imagining that the operating system which our potential senior user working with is either a tablet (touched screen with no mounted typecover) or a PC (Microsoft Windows 10). 


Heuristics | Evaluation | Consideration 
---|---|---
1.Visibility of System Status | *fine* (on PC - **picture 1**): related to the fourth huerestic, the homepage tab does not respond to the movement of the mouse hovering over the letters other than the appearance of a line under them. Since the users have been in interaction with other websites, they wait for a dropdown menu which tells them more about what they will see in Topics, News, etc. As the underline is not making a noticable contrast for our user, scrolling down could be a way to find relavant information about travelling. The transformation of the mouse arrow pointer to a hand is helpful for the user, might convince him/her/their to click. However, as this user does not know what to excpect due to the absence of a dropdown menu, going back and forth to the homepage is highly possible.   | A high contrast between the letters and the underline could be helpful in increading the visibility of the change. A better option is to design a dropdown menu which reponds to the movmeent of of the mouse. A combination of both is another possbility
2.Match Between System and the Real World | *fine* (on any device - **picture 2 & 3**): As the second principle says, it is recommended that designs avoid technical terms which are more enclosed to a limited audience and be closer to a larger and inclusive ones. Moreover, it is better to bring the design components a point which corresponds to the real world. In picture 2 and 3 we see a few terms which might be known for the most English speaking population of U.S., at the same time it causes confusion for others. Salutation, and physical states, country might not be easy to make sense for those who are familiar with one or two types of addresses. | Although we can assume that the website is required to use legal terms, it can provide additional information about them. For example, they can add a small visible balloon with a question mark in it which pops up when a user hovers mouse over it or touch it. 
3.User Control and Freedom | *fine* (on any device - **picture 4, 5, and 6**): When a user tries to search "dent" in the website through the search box, the first would be  picture 4. If she clicks on News and Updates (accidentally or intentionally), she sees picture 5. However, when she wants to go back to the first search result, she confronts a different result than the fist time. | Although this error is reversible by the back button of her Chrome browser, she might not use it in this case. It is better to find out why such a discrepency in search page happens. 
4.Consistency and Standards | *bad* (on PC and tablet - **picture 7 & 8**) When a user clicks on How Do I and on Apply for a U.S. Passport, in the user's fullscreen mode she sees a menu on the left, Expand All Sections in th middle, a directory of where she is on the top left, and a search box on top right (picture 4). If she clicks on Expand All Sections she can see the information under each tab. However, if suddenly the size of the browser window get smaller (1/3 fullscreen), she will have a different arrangement (picture 5). The menu goes to the top left (three lines), the Expand All disappears and the search box appears as a magnifier and Search on top right. This could be categorized as inconsistency within the internal system. We could expect such a change across different devices (phone to PC), but a change in the browser's size could be handled better| In smaller window size, instead of Last Published Date, adding Exand/Collapse All Sections works better is in conssitancy with the system in fullscreen window. Menu and Search can be less blurry and more visible by using different colors and fonts. 
5.Error Prevention | *bad* (on PC and tablet - **picture 9**): If a user wants to file a complaint she is likely to be stuck in the part Flight Date. As the picture shows, a suddent click or a fast scroll down can move the calender to 200 years later. It is not easy for a senior user to find that small stick on the righ of the years, drag it to 2021. She would probably miss it. | It is not necessary to have a calender for the next millennium. 
6.Recognition Rather Than Recall | *bad* (on PC - **picture 1**): The possibility of knowing search history in a browser like Chrome is not hight for a senior user. If she wants to revisit DHS website and go to what she left unfinished, the sixth priciple comes handy. She could open the website, tries to recall which page she visited last time. However, DHS design does not provide a dropdown menu in homepage tab ribbon. A senior user presumably would have a hard time to deal with this issue | A dropdown menu which could succinctly give a demonstration of the website helps the user to recognize which pages she visited last time. 
7.Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | *bad* (on tablet - **picture 9**): Other than using the scroll and click, there is no other way to type numbers in the field. Touching the field/box does not execute an order to the device to use its virtual keyboard. As mentioned in the fifth principle, there is a *bad* issue with this part for a person who want to file a complaint. The design seemingly does not support the tablet keyoard which leave the user with her only option, choosing from the calender with its infinite year.  | It is better to implement (a few lines of) code in the design which executes on-screen keyboard or immediately change the calender design with a more user-friendly one.  
8.Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | *fair* (on PC and tablet - **picture 10**): When a user clicks on the search button in the small size window, the website takes her to another page where one white box is placed on top of a simialr one. The bottom one has a message that use the box above to type your search keywords. Based on the eighth principle it is redundant to have the second box (bottom) | Put the message in the top box and change the color to gray. The text should disappear when a user clicks or touchs the box. 
9.Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | *good-fair* (on any device - **picture 11**): In case of leaving a field empty during filing a complaint, the website directs the user's attention to fields which are required to be filled. However, it does let user leave other fields empty in two previous pages. A user might not notice this error. While the website tried to minize the page lenght by diving the fields in three parts, a user would see a notification about the empty field in the third page. | The error about empty fields must appear in all pages. 
10.Help and Documentation | *bad* (on any device - **picture 3 & 8**): As previously mentioned in the second principle, the website apparantly assumes its users understand the term used in the fields, which could be an incorrect assumption. Providing more details about how to fill the form could be done in a way that neither confuses users nor makes aesthetic flaws. | Adding complementary information in a small clickable/touchable balloon with a "i" letter in them could mitigate the confusion.

### **Severity Evaluation**
Severity Ratings for Usability Problems | Rating
---|---|
There are minor cosmetic problems such as the low contrast between the background and menu button which can be categorized in the lowest priority. Since there are few sections with which users have more interactions (filling forms, calender issue), it is recommended to them as soon as possible. | 2-3

  ### Overall Assessment
The website which is analyzed here contains several pages and information related to the Deparment of Homeland Security and other govermental sections. It is not easy to avoid all the small mistakes in coding and designing. Excepct for the calender part, I do not think the current condition of this website could cause a major issue for the department and its users. Fixing these small issues would probably not take the designers and coders time and not be costly for the government.

## Second: [U.S. Custome and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/about)

The U.S. Costume and Border Protection is a large organization which is responsible for security of U.S. borders, protecting people from threats and U.S. agriculture from potential damages. With more than 60000 employees, it is obvious that this section of the government is dealing with other organizations inside and outside of the country. Therefore, it should not surprise someone to expect a website fulfilling its users' needs and questions. For the second part of assignment, we will analyze ten usability principles for UI Designs. Similar to the first part, the analyses will be supplemented with screenshots from the website and be categorized as *good, fine, bad, worse*. The target users are seniors.

Heuristics | Evaluation | Consideration 
---|---|---
1.Visibility of System Status | *bad* (on any device - **picture 1**): When our senior user (a 76 year-old man) tries to send an email to the realted department, he finds this page and a nice clear sqaure which says "Email Preclearance to Request Application." This page is simple and clickable square is easy to notice on a PC and tablet. The issue is not the visibility but the function of this blue button. It does not do something for the user and no message appears with any further information.   | The code should be changed or updated: it must excecute the order. Either link the button to an external source or create a popup message which provides information about why it does not work (which is in contrast with the eighth principle).
2.Match Between System and the Real World | *bad* (on any device - **picture 2**): When the user wants to learn about the I-94 forms and how to get the most recent I-94 in order to provide it to an organization, the CBP website directs him to an instruction. Beside the bad resolution of the instruction, the designers tried to add something to convey a message to users that you should click on this blue button. They added "click" with low visible color at the bottom of the cursor (mouse) and an orange circle with three dark (spiky) lines around it. It is understandable that they were trying to emphasize on the clicking action (that just hovering the mouse over it does not do something). However, the shape they used does not represent the action of clicking in reality  | The spiky circle should be replaced with a clear message. If they cannot provide instruction in GIF format, at least adding a message like "click/touch here" prevents possible confusion.   
3.User Control and Freedom | *bad* (on PC and tablet) - **picture 3 & 4**): In small size window, the homepage menu changes from a tab ribbon to three line button menu. When a user clicks on the button (if he finds it due to the low contrast between lighter blue and darker blue) a nice list (picture 3) appear with a clear plus (+) sign on the right side of each title. If the user click or touch each of these plus signs, they expand to more titles which are linked to different pages in the website. Although this is a great option which only appears in reduced size window, the issue is the difficulty for a senior user to scroll up to the top of the page. | Simply, a top button which moves the page to the beginning resovles the issue
4.Consistency and Standards | *fine-bad* (on PC and tablet - **picture 5 & 6**) Following the previous principle, the menu tranformation -from dropdown menu (sensetive to the mouse movement) to an expandable list menu (picture 3 & 4)- is significant. It list menu is detailed with many links and titles while the one captured in picture 5 does not resemble the other one. Picture 6 shows that for a page which does not need a top/up button, designers considered one. However, for the list menu (picture 4) they did not add it to facilitate the scrolling up issue for some senior users. | The homepage tab menu should be more similar to the list menu. The top/up button must be added to all long pages.
5.Error Prevention | *worse* (on PC - **picture 7 & 8**): There is a useful page for users in  CBP wesite which provides details about what travellers can and cannot bring in to the country. As pciture 7 demonstrates, there are an expandable list of items and categories with useful information and links which answer the majority of basic questions. On the top right corner of the page, there is another useful piece "Printer-friendly version" if someone wants to print this page and reads it on paper or later on the his device. When a user clicks on it, all tabs opens in expansion mode. The designer considered "Expand All" button there but the reason is not clear (unless someone wants to print the titles). The issue of this section is if user accidently touches or click on one of these tabs (titles), it gets closed/collapsed which should not be a problem. However, as picture 8 shows, the text in the collapsed tab appears overalpped on its bottom tab, results in a scrambled text. | Either the design should remove this option which might be coflict with the seventh and ninth principle, or edit the code to prevent this issue.
6.Recognition Rather Than Recall | *bad* (on PC - **picture 9, 10, & 11**): It is not hard for a user to find the page to get his more recent I-94 (picture 10). When he checks the instruction, he finds out that Alien registration number is also called A number. And at the bottom of the instruction the blue balloon (picture 11) repeats the term "Enter your 'A' number". There is no doubt that Passport Number is (also) Alien number or A number. When the user goes to the page to fill the form, the additional information (circle with a question mark) does not prvide details about A number at all (picture 9) which makes the user confused. Apparently, it is realted to the second principle.  | Change the confusing information or remove them from the insturction. If A number is something other than a passport number which U.S. or other countries provide, it should be noted clearly, without assuming that all users know the difference.  
7.Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | *fine-bad* (on OC and tablet - **picture 12**): The website works well both with PC's physical and tablet's on-screen keyboard. If user's device keyboard suddenly stops working, he might not be able to fill forms in this website. Although PC has an on-screen keyboard, it still needs a complex way to activate it. | A floating keyboard icon is necessary in pages with forms.
8.Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | *bad* (on PC - **picture 13, 14, 15, 16; 8, 6**): Simialr to what we saw in the second principle, therer are aesthetic issues in a few parts which were analyzed for this assignment. | From no margin (picture 15) to the disorderly design of For International Traverllers page (picture 13), the desigers could pay attention to these details by (a) removing excessive objects (b) choose a better color combination (c) avoid overlapping texts, in order to provide a less confusing visual field for the users.
9.Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | *good-fair* (on PC and tablet - **picture 16**): The website also provides links to the application both for android and ios. It is not difficult to navigate through the website and find the page. The website has two picture buttons for Google Play and App Store. When a user clicks/touches them, a warning message appears (picture 16). While two buttons, OK and Cancel are overlapping the text, they are still providing options to the user between leaving the website or cancel the action. There is at least one issue with this warning message. Two buttons are too close to one another: a user might not be able to make a contact with the button he intends to touch. The desig did not consider the different size of humans fingers and also if users suffers from some hand problems like Parkinson. | There is enough space under the text. The gap between the buttons and and the size of them can be increased. 
10.Help and Documentation | *worse* (on any device - **picture 17**): Earlier we read about the instruction for filling out the I-94 form. At the end of the instruction (picture 17), it tells users how to print the result which is a plus based on the ninth principle. However, the shortcut does not execute print but it just copies the object (if it does). No shortcut for Mac users.| CTRL+C must be replaced by CTRL+P. It must consider other OS users such as Mac, and provide the shortcut: CMND + P.
