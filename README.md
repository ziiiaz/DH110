# Understanding Senior Users' Frustration of Multiple Clicking, Touching, and Scrolling 
DH110 Weekly Assignment - Week One | Zia Khoshsirat

## First: [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/)
The Department of Homeland Security tries to provide basic but sufficcient information in its website to the potential audience/users regarding the rights, regualtions, and most recent changes which might affect U.S. citizens and foreign travellers. While this department is responsible for varieties of tasks and regulations, the website is fairly simple, avoides an excessively busy homepage. Most of the website's information are placed on a tab ribbon (picture 1)

The issues which I will describe based on the ten hueristics are observed inside these tabs and the tab itself. These issues are tried to be demostrated in separate screenshots and highlighted with red dash lines. In the table below, the evaluation is categorized as *fine*, *bad*, *worse*. The analysis is performed by imagining that the operating system which our potential senior user working with is either a tablet (touched screen with no mounted typecover) or a PC (Microsoft Windows 10). 


Heuristics | Evaluation | Consideration 
---|---|---
1.Visibility of System Status | *fine* (on PC - **picture 1**): related to the fourth huerestic, the homepage tab does not respond to the movement of the mouse hovering over the letters other than the appearance of a line under them. Since the users have been in interaction with other websites, they wait for a dropdown menu which tells them more about what they will see in Topics, News, etc. As the underline is not making a noticable contrast for our user, scrolling down could be a way to find relavant information about travelling. The transformation of the mouse arrow pointer to a hand is helpful for the user, might convince him/her/their to click. However, as this user does not know what to excpect due to the absence of a dropdown menu, going back and forth to the homepage is highly possible.   | A high contrast between the letters and the underline could be helpful in increading the visibility of the change. A better option is to design a dropdown menu which reponds to the movmeent of of the mouse. A combination of both is another possbility
2.Match Between System and the Real World | *fine* (on any device - **picture 2 & 3**): As the second principle says, it is recommended that designs avoid technical terms which are more enclosed to a limited audience and be closer to a larger and inclusive ones. Moreover, it is better to bring the design components a point which corresponds to the real world. In picture 2 and 3 we see a few terms which might be known for the most English speaking population of U.S., at the same time it causes confusion for others. Salutation, and physical states, country might not be easy to make sense for those who are familiar with one or two types of addresses. | Although we can assume that the website is required to use legal terms, it can provide additional information about them. For example, they can add a small visible balloon with a question mark in it which pops up when a user hovers mouse over it or touch it. 
3.User Control and Freedom | *fine* (on any device - **picture 4, 5, and 6**): When a user tries to search "dent" in the website through the search box, the first would be  picture 4. If she clicks on News and Updates (accidentally or intentionally), she sees picture 5. However, when she wants to go back to the first search result, she confronts a different result than the fist time. | Although this error is reversible by the back button of her Chrome browser, she might not use it in this case. It is better to find out why such a discrepency in search page happens. 
4.Consistency and Standards | *bad* (on PC and tablet - **picture 7 & 8**) When a user clicks on How Do I and on Apply for a U.S. Passport, in the user's fullscreen mode she sees a menu on the left, Expand All Sections in th middle, a directory of where she is on the top left, and a search box on top right (picture 4). If she clicks on Expand All Sections she can see the information under each tab. However, if suddenly the size of the browser window get smaller (1/3 fullscreen), she will have a different arrangement (picture 5). The menu goes to the top left (three lines), the Expand All disappears and the search box appears as a magnifier and Search on top right. This could be categorized as inconsistency within the internal system. We could expect such a change across different devices (phone to PC), but a change in the browser's size could be handled better| In smaller window size, instead of Last Published Date, adding Exand/Collapse All Sections works better is in conssitancy with the system in fullscreen window. Menu and Search can be less blurry and more visible by using different colors and fonts. 
5.Error Prevention | *bad* (on PC and tablet - **picture 9**): If a user wants to file a complaint she is likely to be stuck in the part Flight Date. As the picture shows, a suddent click or a fast scroll down can move the calender to 200 years later. It is not easy for a senior user to find that small stick on the righ of the years, drag it to 2021. She would probably miss it. | It is not necessary to have a calender for the next millennium. 
6.Recognition Rather Than Recall | *bad* (on PC - **picture 1**): The possibility of knowing search history in a browser like Chrome is not hight for a senior user. If she wants to revisit DHS website and go to what she left unfinished, the sixth priciple comes handy. She could open the website, tries to recall which page she visited last time. However, DHS design does not provide a dropdown menu in homepage tab ribbon. A senior user presumably would have a hard time to deal with this issue | A dropdown menu which could succinctly give a demonstration of the website helps the user to recognize which pages she visited last time. 
7.Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | *bad* (on tablet - **picture 9**): Other than using the scroll and click, there is no other way to type numbers in the field. Touching the field/box does not execute an order to the device to use its virtual keyboard. As mentioned in the fifth principle, there is a *bad* issue with this part for a person who want to file a complaint. The design seemingly does not support the tablet keyoard which leave the user with her only option, choosing from the calender with its infinite year.  | It is better to implement (a few lines of) code in the design which executes on-screen keyboard or immediately change the calender design with a more user-friendly one.
