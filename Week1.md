The Department of Homeland Security tries to provide basic but sufficient information to the potential audience/users regarding the rights, regualtions, and most recent changes that might affect U.S. citizens and foreign travelers. While this department is responsible for various tasks and regulations, the website is fairly simple, avoids an excessively busy homepage. Most of the website's information is placed on a tab ribbon (picture 1)

</p>
Based on the ten heuristics, the issues I will describe are observed inside these tabs and the tab itself. These issues are tried to be demonstrated in separate screenshots and highlighted with red dash lines. The evaluation below is categorized as *good, fine, bad, worse*. The analysis is performed by imagining that the operating system which our potential senior user working with is either a tablet (touched screen with no mounted type cover) or a PC (Microsoft Windows 10). 


Heuristics | Evaluation | Consideration 
---|---|---
1.Visibility of System Status | *fine* (on PC - **picture 1**): related to the fourth heuristic, the homepage tab does not respond to the movement of the mouse hovering over the letters other than the appearance of a line under them. Since the users have been interacting with other websites, they wait for a dropdown menu that tells them more about what they will see in Topics, News, etc. As the underline is not making a noticeable contrast for our user, scrolling down could be a way to find relevant information about traveling. The transformation of the mouse arrow pointer to a hand is helpful for the user, might convince him/her/them to click. However, as this user does not know what to expect due to the absence of a dropdown menu, going back and forth to the homepage is highly possible.   | A high contrast between the letters and the underline could help increase the visibility of the change. A better option is to design a dropdown menu that responds to the movement of the mouse. A combination of both is another possibility
2.Match Between System and the Real World | *fine* (on any device - **picture 2 & 3**): As the second principle says, it is recommended that designs avoid technical terms which are more enclosed to a limited audience and be closer to a larger and inclusive one. Moreover, it is better to bring the design components to the point that corresponds to the real world. In pictures 2 and 3, we see a few terms that might be known for the most English-speaking population of the U.S.; simultaneously, it causes confusion for others. Salutation and physical states, the physical country might not be easy to make sense for those who are familiar with one or two types of addresses. | Although we can assume that the website is required to use legal terms, it can provide additional information about them. For example, they can add a small visible balloon with a question mark that pops up when a user hovers mouse over it or touches it. 
3.User Control and Freedom | *fine* (on any device - **picture 4, 5, and 6**): When a user tries to search "dent" in the website through the search box, the first would be picture 4. If she clicks on News and Updates (accidentally or intentionally), she sees picture 5. However, when she wants to go back to the first search result, she confronts a different result than the first time. | Although this error is reversible by the back button of her Chrome browser, she might not use it in this case. It is better to find out why such a discrepancy in the search page happens. 
4.Consistency and Standards | *bad* (on PC and tablet - **picture 7 & 8**) When a user clicks on How Do I and on Apply for a U.S. Passport, in the user's fullscreen mode, she sees a menu on the left, Expand All Sections in the middle, a directory of where she is on the top left, and a search box on the top right (picture 4). If she clicks on Expand All Sections, she can see the information under each tab. However, if suddenly the browser window size gets smaller (1/3 fullscreen), she will have a different arrangement (picture 5). The menu goes to the top left (three lines), the Expand All disappears, and the search box appears as a magnifier and Search on the top right. This could be categorized as an inconsistency within the internal system. We could expect such a change across different devices (phone to PC), but a change in the browser's size could be handled better| In smaller window size, instead of Last Published Date, adding Expand/Collapse All Sections works better is inconsistency with the system in a fullscreen window. Menu and Search can be less blurry and more visible by using different colors and fonts. 
5.Error Prevention | *bad* (on PC and tablet - **picture 9**): If a user wants to file a complaint, she is likely to be stuck in the part Flight Date. As the picture shows, a sudden click or a fast scroll down can move the calendar 200 years later. It is not easy for a senior user to find that small stick on the right of the years, drag it to 2021. She would probably miss it. | It is not necessary to have a calendar for the next millennium. 
6.Recognition Rather Than Recall | *bad* (on PC - **picture 1**): The possibility of knowing search history in a browser like Chrome is not high for a senior user. If she wants to revisit the DHS website and go to what she left unfinished, the sixth principle comes in handy. She could open the website, tried to recall which page she visited last time. However, DHS design does not provide a dropdown menu in the homepage tab ribbon. A senior user presumably would have a hard time dealing with this issue | A dropdown menu which could succinctly give a demonstration of the website helps the user recognize which pages she visited last time. 
7.Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | *bad* (on a tablet - **picture 9**): Other than using the scroll and click, there is no other way to type numbers in the field. Touching the field/box does not execute an order for the device to use its virtual keyboard. As mentioned in the fifth principle, there is a *bad* issue with this part for a person who wants to file a complaint. The design seemingly does not support the tablet keyboard, leaving the user with her only option, choosing from the calendar with its infinite year.  | It is better to implement (a few lines of) codes in the design which executes the on-screen keyboard or immediately change the calendar design with a more user-friendly one.  
8.Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | *fair* (on PC and tablet - **picture 10**): When a user clicks on the search button in the small size window, the website takes her to another page where one white box is placed on top of a similar one. The bottom one has a message that uses the box above to type your search keywords. Based on the eighth principle, it is redundant to have the second box (bottom) | Put the message in the top box and change the color to gray. The text should disappear when a user clicks or touches the box. 
9.Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | *good-fair* (on any device - **picture 11**): In case of leaving a field empty while filing a complaint, the website directs the user's attention to fields that are required to be filled. However, it does let the user leave other fields empty in two previous pages. A user might not notice this error. While the website tried to minimize the page length by dividing the fields into three parts, a user would see a notification about the empty field on the third page. | The error about empty fields must appear on all pages. 
10.Help and Documentation | *bad* (on any device - **picture 3 & 8**): As previously mentioned in the second principle, the website apparently assumes its users understand the term used in the fields, which could be an incorrect assumption. Providing more details about how to fill the form could be done so that neither confuses users nor makes aesthetic flaws. | Adding complementary information in a small clickable/touchable balloon with an "i" letter in them could mitigate the confusion.

### **Severity Evaluation**
Severity Ratings for Usability Problems | Rating
---|---|
There are minor cosmetic problems such as the low contrast between the background and menu button, categorized in the lowest priority. Since there are few sections with which users have more interactions (filling forms, calendar issue), it is recommended to them as soon as possible. | 2-3

  ### Overall Assessment
The website analyzed here contains several pages and information related to the Department of Homeland Security and other governmental sections. It is not easy to avoid all the small mistakes in coding and designing. Except for the calendar part, I do not think the current condition of this website could cause a significant issue for the department and its users. Fixing these minor issues would probably not take the designers' and coders' time and not be costly for the government.

## Second: [U.S. Custome and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/about)


<details>
<summary>"click to expand"</summary>
 
The U.S. Costume and Border Protection is a large organization responsible for the security of U.S. borders, protecting people from threats and U.S. agriculture from potential damages. With more than 60000 employees, it is evident that this section of the government is dealing with other organizations inside and outside of the country. Therefore, it should not surprise someone to expect a website fulfilling its users' needs and questions. For the second part of the assignment, we will analyze ten usability principles for UI Designs. Similar to the first part, the analyses will be supplemented with screenshots from the website and be categorized as *good, fine, bad, worse*. The target users are seniors.

Heuristics | Evaluation | Consideration 
---|---|---
1.Visibility of System Status | *bad* (on any device - **picture 1**): When our senior user (a 76-year-old man) tries to send an email to the related department, he finds this page and a lovely clear square which says "Email Preclearance to Request Application." This page is clickable and straightforward square is easy to notice on a PC and tablet. The issue is not the visibility but the function of this blue button. It does not do something for the user, and no message appears with any further information.   | The code should be changed or updated: it must execute the order. Either link the button to an external source or create a popup message that provides information about why it does not work (in contrast with the eighth principle).
2.Match Between System and the Real World | *bad* (on any device - **picture 2**): When the user wants to learn about the I-94 forms and how to get the most recent I-94 in order to provide it to an organization, the CBP website directs him to an instruction. Besides the insufficient resolution of the instruction, the designers tried to convey a message to users that they should click on this blue button. They added "click" with low visible color at the bottom of the cursor (mouse) and an orange circle with three dark (spiky) lines around it. Understandably, they were trying to emphasize the clicking action (that just hovering the mouse over it does not do something). However, their shape does not represent the action of clicking in reality. | The spiky circle should be replaced with a clear message. If they cannot provide instruction in GIF format, at least adding a message like "click/touch here" prevents possible confusion.   
3.User Control and Freedom | *bad* (on PC and tablet) - **picture 3 & 4**): In a small size window, the homepage menu changes from a tab ribbon to a three-line button. When a user clicks on the button (if he finds it due to the low contrast between light blue and darker blue), a nice list (picture 3) appears with a clear plus (+) sign on the right side of each title. If the user clicks or touches each of these plus signs, they expand to more titles linked to different pages on the website. Although this is a great option that only appears in a reduced size window, it is difficult for a senior user to scroll up to the top of the page. |A top button that moves the page to the beginning resolves the issue
4.Consistency and Standards | *fine-bad* (on PC and tablet - **picture 5 & 6**) Following the previous principle, the menu transformation -from the dropdown menu (sensitive to the mouse movement) to an expandable list menu (picture 3 & 4)- is significant. The list menu has many links and titles, while the one captured in picture 5 does not resemble the other one. Picture 6 shows that designers considered one for a page that does not need a top/up button. However, for the list menu (picture 4), they did not add the list menu to facilitate the scrolling up issue for some senior users for the list menu. | The homepage tab menu should be more similar to the list menu. The top/up button must be added to all long pages.
5.Error Prevention | *worse* (on PC - **picture 7 & 8**): A helpful page for users on the CBP website provides details about what travelers can and cannot bring into the country. As picture 7 demonstrates, there is an expandable list of items and categories with useful information and links that answer the most basic questions. There is another helpful piece on the top right corner of the page, "Printer-friendly version," if someone wants to print this page and reads it on paper or later on his device. When a user clicks on it, all tabs open in expansion mode. The designer considered the "Expand All" button there, but the reason is not apparent (unless someone wants to print the titles). The issue of this section is that if the user accidently touches or clicks on one of these tabs (titles), it gets closed/collapsed, which should not be a problem. However, as picture 8 shows, the text in the collapsed tab appears overlapped on its bottom tab, results in a scrambled text. | Either the design should remove this option which might be conflict with the seventh and ninth principles, or edit the code to prevent this issue.
6.Recognition Rather Than Recall | *bad* (on PC - **picture 9, 10, & 11**): It is not hard for a user to find the page to get his more recent I-94 (picture 10). When he checks the instruction, he finds out that the Alien registration number is also called A number. And at the bottom of the instruction, the blue balloon (picture 11) repeats the term "Enter your 'A' number." There is no doubt that the Passport Number is (also) an Alien number or A number. When the user goes to the page to fill the form, the additional information (circle with a question mark) does not provide details about A number (picture 9) which makes the user confused. It is related to the second principle.  | Change the confusing information or remove them from the instruction. If A number is something other than a passport number that the U.S. or other countries provide, it should be noted clearly, without assuming that all users know the difference.  
7.Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | *fine-bad* (on OC and tablet - **picture 12**): The website works well with PC's physical and tablet's on-screen keyboard. If the user's device keyboard suddenly stops working, he might not be able to fill out forms on this website. Although PC has an on-screen keyboard, it still needs a complex way to activate it. | A floating keyboard icon is necessary for pages with forms.
8.Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | *bad* (on PC - **picture 13, 14, 15, 16; 8, 6**): Similar to what we saw in the second principle, there are aesthetic issues in a few parts which were analyzed for this assignment. | From no margin (picture 15) to the disorderly design of For International Travelers page (picture 13), the designers could pay attention to these details by (a) removing excessive objects (b) choose a better color combination (c) avoid overlapping texts, in order to provide a less confusing visual field for the users.
9.Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | *good-fair* (on PC and tablet - **picture 16**): The website also provides links to the application both for android and ios. It is not difficult to navigate through the website and find the page. The website has two picture buttons for Google Play and App Store. When a user clicks/touches them, a warning message appears (picture 16). While two buttons, OK and Cancel, overlap the text, they still provide options to the user between leaving the website or canceling the action. There is at least one issue with this warning message. Two buttons are too close to one another: a user might not be able to contact the button he intends to touch. The design did not consider the different sizes of humans' fingers and if users suffer from hand problems like Parkinson. | There is enough space under the text. The gap between the buttons and the size of them can be increased. 
10.Help and Documentation | *worse* (on any device - **picture 17**): Earlier, we read about the instruction for filling out the I-94 form. The end of the instruction (picture 17) tells users how to print the result, which is a plus based on the ninth principle. However, the shortcut does not execute print, but it just copies the object (if it does)—no shortcut for Mac users.| CTRL+C must be replaced by CTRL+P. It must consider other OS users such as Mac and provide the shortcut: CMND + P.

### **Severity Evaluation**
Severity Ratings for Usability Problems | Rating
---|---|
Besides the aesthetic issues, we see critical problems with the website, which must be solved as soon as possible. For example, the ctrl + c does frustrate a senior user. This is not a cosmetic error which our eyes might compensate for it.   | 3

  ### Overall Assessment
The Custome and Border Protection is a large organization with numerous divisions and related sections. The website contains hundreds of pages that must cover its users' needs and requests. Those pages were analyzed here sometimes demonstrate a weak graphic design. There is evidence that the designers assumed users' physical ability and computer knowledge. At least one piece of evidence clearly shows that the designer surmised PC/Windows as the default device.
